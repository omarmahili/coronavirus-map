          PREAMBLE
          The goals of the Open Font License (OFL) are to stimulate worldwide
          development of collaborative font projects, to support the font creation
          efforts of academic and linguistic communities, and to provide a free and
          open framework in which fonts may be shared and improved in partnership
          with others.
          <br /><br />
          The OFL allows the licensed fonts to be used, studied, modified and
          redistributed freely as long as they are not sold by themselves. The
          fonts, including any derivative works, can be bundled, embedded,
          redistributed and/or sold with any software provided that any reserved
          names are not used by derivative works. The fonts and derivatives,
          however, cannot be released under any other type of license. The
          requirement for fonts to remain under this license does not apply
          to any document created using the fonts or their derivatives.
          <br /><br />

          PERMISSION & CONDITIONS
          Permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining
          a copy of the Font Software, to use, study, copy, merge, embed, modify,
          redistribute, and sell modified and unmodified copies of the Font

          <br /><br />
          2) Original or Modified Versions of the Font Software may be bundled,
          redistributed and/or sold with any software, provided that each copy

          included either as stand-alone text files, human-readable headers or
          in the appropriate machine-readable metadata fields within text or
          binary files as long as those fields can be easily viewed by the user.
          <br /><br />
          3) No Modified Version of the Font Software may use the Reserved Font

          presented to the users.
          <br /><br />
          4) The name(s) of the Copyright Holder(s) or the Author(s) of the Font

          This license becomes null and void if any of the above conditions are
          not met.
          <br /><br />
